# Planning and keeping track of things for my website


I want it to look nicer. Not sure exactly what that means
I kinda want to *understand* how this site works, using Jekyll or whatever.

I want to have a section for personal projects and random things I want to create.

Maybe one things is having a "random" page where I can link site pages that are for random things.


Man, it would be cool to have little fishes swimming around in a Frutiger Aero aesthetic by I fear that might be too much for a Jekyll site

10/29:
- Let's play with making things look cooler
    - The "Share on" buttons at the bottom of pages look so lame. I want to get rid of them. DONE
    - The site generally feels rather corpo and professional and I want it to feel warmer and like I'm just spending time with someone.
    - Make "random" page in the menu so that I can add pages that are just fun or so there.
- Update info
    - Add teaching experience in that I'm technically a co-lecturer for graduate medical education (statistics) - maybe this just goes in cv directly instead of in "teaching"?
    - Add some talks: COR 2025, BME Pruitt Day (wow this was also Op Note paper. Does it look bad that I'm dragging this so much)
    - COR Research Award! Oberndorf Scholarship!
    - Add APSA WebOps
