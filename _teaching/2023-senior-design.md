I once again supervised a group of undergraduate computer science students in their senior design project.
I led 9 students between 2 teams to create a more robust code base for our lab's AI work.
More specifically, we implemented a PyTorch Lightning-based framework for computer vision tasks using Weights and Biases experiment tracking and a custom configuration manager.
