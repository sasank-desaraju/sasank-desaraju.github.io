Hello, World!


This is about the similarities between the medical student learning process and LLM training process.

Pretraining = Anki

RLHF = Clinical Practice such as EAC


If med students are great at Anki, do they really *know* the information?

Humans are good at navigating the sparse rewards of clinical practice, but LLMs are not so good at navigating the sparse rewards of RLHF.
