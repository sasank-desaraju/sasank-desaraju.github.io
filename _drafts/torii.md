Hello, World!


The Tori-i gate is a symbol in Japan for the boundary between the Sacred and the Profane.

Medicine has made me question whether such a sharp distinction exists, as the physician must step between these worlds constantly.

In my undergrad, I felt assured that my study of physics and mathematics was sacred. Pursuit of these did not involve memorization, but monkish meditation on a few fundamental concepts and the application of Divine logic. Zen koans = quantum mechanics and abstract algebra.

Compared to this, medical knowledge seemed at once Profane. Consisting mostly of memorization of arbitrary facts, relying often on…colorful…mnemonics.

Understanding of abstruse biochemical pathways is a prerequisite to helping a child with a genetic metabolic disease, a Sacred endeavor. Is knowledge required to perform this, then, not sacred itself? But how can memorizing a song about the urea cycle be sacred?

An ailing person might acquire C. difficile diarrhea, known for its awful smell. How much more Profane can you get, as you perform the Sacred task of healing.

All knowledge is Sacred.
