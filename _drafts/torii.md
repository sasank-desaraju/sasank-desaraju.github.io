Hello, World!


The Tori-i gate is a symbol in Japan for the boundary between the Sacred and the Profane.

Medicine has made me question whether such a sharp distinction exists, as the physician must step between these worlds constantly.

In my undergrad, I felt assured that my study of physics and mathematics was sacred. Pursuit of these did not involve memorization, but monkish meditation on a few fundamental concepts and the application of Divine logic. Zen koans = quantum mechanics and abstract algebra.

Compared to this, medical knowledge seemed at once Profane. Consisting mostly of memorization of arbitrary facts, relying often on…colorful…mnemonics.

Understanding of abstruse biochemical pathways is a prerequisite to helping a child with a genetic metabolic disease, a Sacred endeavor. Is knowledge required to perform this, then, not sacred itself? But how can memorizing a song about the urea cycle be sacred?

An ailing person might acquire C. difficile diarrhea, known for its awful smell. How much more Profane can you get, as you perform the Sacred task of healing.

All knowledge is Sacred.




Okay, it's 11/20 and we are writing this.

Okay, my thinking was about the surprising sacredness of medical knowledge and my journey to discovering this.

When I started college, I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I pursued physics and mathematics.
After all, *that's* the Secret Sauce.

>*Learn these Sacred arts, and all the machinations of the world will appear before you and be known to you.*

I thought that if I spent my time learning these disciplines, which seemed at the source of everything else, that I would be prepared for any other venture I wanted to get into down the road.
They were about understanding grander concepts, not mere memorization of random facts like in biology class.
The insights I would gain from this were profound and universal - and the structure of the knowledge reflected that.
The claims made were true all over the universe, and we were learning the full stack: from fundamental set theory to complex theorems and from the vibrations of atoms to the motions of galaxies.
The things I learned in physics and mathematics were magical, and still are!

The geometry of vector calculus.
The rigid creativity of formal logic and mathematical proofs.
The magic of partial differentials in Thermodynamics.
Fourier transforms and Louiville's theorem.
The unabashed nessecity (?) of Electrodynamics.
The formless shapes of Abstract Algebra.

The laws and formulae I learned guided the motion of the tiniest particle and largest galaxy along with every school bus, egret, lodestone, Cambodian, silicon wafer, Barbie doll, bacteriophage, and Chicago deep dish pizza in history.
This knowledge was obviously *Sacred*.

This is all in stark contrast to silly biology classes.
I took some in high school and, at my parents' behest, a couple more in college to keep the door to med school open.
It was all the same:
The statistical noise of which plants, animals, and proteins happened to inhabit the earth at the present moment was crammed into a few dozen poorly-formatted powerpoint slides.


Yes, there were some patterns but they were so many random facts that students had to come up with funny acronyms as mnemonic devices.
We had [mnemonic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mnemonic) devices to learn things in physics too - it was called *understanding*.



It was all the same - some squiggly little thing was misrecognized as something else a good 50 years ago and 

Memorizing the names of bacteria (or that "G-protein coupled receptors" had specifically *7* transmembrane domains) was *woefully* pedestrian.



As I turned toward medicine, I still kept my same smug attitude
