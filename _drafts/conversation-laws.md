Illusory Conservation Laws (and Why You Should Try to Win At Everything)


*"Ugh, this salad tastes so lame but I guess it must be healthy."*
*"Fashion models usually don't know much."*

These are statments one often hears, perhaps from their own mouth.
What people may not realize is that these statements assume "conservation laws", which is a notion that is quite important in physics.

People, often unknowingly, tend to purport conservation laws in many everyday scenarios.

*"Basketball players can either be tall or short, but not both."*
*"Someone can be hot or smart, but not both."*

## The Naked Peril of Dropping Illusory Conservation Laws

If we drop these illusions, there are some scary ideas we have to face:
*Are some people just better than others?*

*So some people are just worse at everything?*
*What an awful thought! Should I feel bad for thinking that?*
*How should I think about people who worse at everything?*

*What does that mean about me?*
*If some people can be good at everything, what's stopping me?*
