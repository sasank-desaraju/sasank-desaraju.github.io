This is a collection of my thoughts from the preclinical years of medical school and some tips I would give.
This is all just the opinion of one person, so take what you want and leave the rest.

You should read Ultralearning.

# Before Medical School Starts

The summer before medical starts, I don't really think one should "study" in preparation.
I think this is time better spent in other pursuits, such as traveling, reading, hobbies, exercise, and spending time with loved ones.
Althought I had to finish up my master's thesis during the summer, I also went to a conference in Chicago, vacationed to Iceland with my parents, attended an EDM festival, led my buddy's bachelor party in Nashville, broke my shoulder and had surgery, and completed the Barbenheimer movie challenge with my new MD/PhD friends.

If it's been 10 years since biochem and you want to brush up on that, then go for it.
But I don't think you're going to "get ahead" by studying before med school.
You could study a subject for a 3 weeks on your own, and then med school blows through that content in 1 week once things kick off.
This is if you even know exactly what to study, which is hard to do without the specific syllabus your med school uses.

## Ultralearning

That being said, I have one piece of Required Reading for you: [*Ultralearning*](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) by Scott Young.
This book is about learning taken to a "superhuman" level.
Winning Scrabble in a foreign tongue, completing MIT's 4-year computer science curriculum in one year, and learning a language in 3 months.
Except this is not superhuman and you can do something like this as well.
In fact, I think the preclinical years are a sort of "Ultralearning" bootcamp where you will learn an insane amount of information that will change the way you look at the world.

This book is good for you for a number of reasons:
1. It will move your mental ["Overton Window"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) of what is possible for a human and, thus, what is possible for you.
2. It will teach you a framework and set of tools to learn effectively yourself, useful for medicine and anything else you can think of.
3. It will start to prepare your mind for the vast undertaking you will soon embark. You won't be fully prepared (no one is), but you will recognize what you are doing: Ultralearning.

I "read" this on [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/Ultralearning-Audiobook/0062945149) in a week or two of MS2.
It's only 7.5 hours on 1x speed so easy to finish while doing chores or driving.


# Learning Strategies and Approaches

Much has been said on the "best" studying techniques (outlining, Pomodoro, Anki, Feynman Method, group studying, solo studying, highlighting, etc.).
I will comment only on topics that require more emphasis or discussion, leaving aside many techniques that may work well for you.
You should find out for yourself.

# How much should you study in the preclinical years?

*"Step 1 is pass/fail now, so you don't need to study as much."*

I passed Step 1 without too much difficulty. *I wish I had studied harder in my preclinical years.*

The preclinical curriculum is truly the foundation for everything else in medicine, and your first two years are the only time you have set aside for it.
The random factoids on your powerpoints do not just go away after this. Rather, you will simply be expected to know it.

I really recommend studying as hard as you can in the first two years.
Your main goals in life are to learn as much as you can, and to let that change your way of thinking.
